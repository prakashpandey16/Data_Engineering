# Example of Hybrid Inheritance
# Define the base class
class BaseClass:
    pass  # This class currently has no methods or attributes

# Define the first derived class
class DerivedClass1:
    pass  # This class currently has no methods or attributes

# Define the second derived class
class DerivedClass2:
    pass  # This class currently has no methods or attributes

# Define a third derived class that inherits from both DerivedClass1 and DerivedClass2
class DerivedClass3(DerivedClass1, DerivedClass2):
    pass  # This class currently has no methods or attributes
